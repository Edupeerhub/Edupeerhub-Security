# EduPeerHub Security Policy
## 1. Vulnerability Disclosure
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the EduPeerHub application, please report it to our cybersecurity team immediately.

## 2. Secure Coding Practices
All developers are expected to follow secure coding practices. Key practices include:
- **Input Validation:** All user input must be sanitized and validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQLi, XSS).
- **Parameterized Queries:** Use parameterized queries for all database interactions.
- **Secure Password Storage:** Never store passwords in plain text. Use strong, salted hashing algorithms.
- **Authentication:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms, including MFA for administrative roles.

## 3. Incident Response
In the event of a security incident, please follow the defined incident response plan.
[Link to your Incident Response Plan, if you have one].
